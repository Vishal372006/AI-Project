# Objective of the project

**Mapping health care facilities :-** Identify the number of types of health care facilities, which include hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and specialized centers in the countryside.

**Distance to health services:** Calculate the average distance or travel time that would be needed for rural dwellers to reach the nearest healthcare facility. Travel times are considered in terms of traveling by car, public transportation, or other means.

**Availability of healthcare professionals:** Examine the distribution of healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, specialists, etc.) in rural areas.

**Literacy(%) :-** The percentage of population or people who can able to read or write in an rural area.

**Avaibility of beds in hospitals :-** The total number of beds distributed and are available per 100,000 population in the rural area for understanding the distribution of bed per person in the perticular area.

**Workforce shortages:** Determine if there is a shortage of healthcare workers in rural settings and the effects of this shortage on delivery. 

**Cost of healthcare:** Evaluate the cost of healthcare services in rural areas, including out-of-pocket expenses, travel costs, and availability of insurance coverage.

# Key features
 # Limited Number of Facilities
 
**Few healthcare facilities:** These areas usually contain fewer healthcare facilities than developed cities or towns, including hospitals, clinics, and specialty centers. The distance traveled may often be longer for residents to access such healthcare services.

**Smaller health networks:** The health system in the rural areas is usually small and not well integrated, hence having fewer choices for patients to select providers or specialists.

# Geographic Disparities

**Distance to nearest facility:** In general, rural areas have much greater distances to the nearest healthcare facility than their urban counterparts. Residents may need to travel long distances, sometimes for hours, to access primary care, emergency services, or specialty care.

**rural communities**:Some rural communities are isolated or mountainous and, therefore, face extra geographic barriers. Poor roads and lack of road accessibility may further compound issues of access.

# Healthcare Facility Type and Specialization

**Predominantly primary care services:** Rural areas often have more primary care providers (e.g., family doctors, general practitioners) but fewer specialists or specialty care services. This results in a reliance on generalists for a broad range of medical issues.

**Restricted Emergency and Specialty Care:** Very few hospitals with emergency, surgical facilities, or special diagnostics exist in most of the rural areas. Sometimes, the rural population requires traveling to cities for specialized services.

# Healthcare Facility Accessibility

**Transportation issues:** Lack of accessible public transport facilities and a long distance make accessing healthcare services in rural settings difficult. The elderly in rural settings and others with no transport may find it challenging to reach the health care facilities.

**Telemedicine:** Telemedicine has paved a way for many rural locations to introduce remote consultations and e-health services. However, lack of good internet access and technology is still not a possibility for some residents.

# Workforce Shortages

**Healthcare personnel:** healthcare personnel are too few, sometimes even lack specialists: Not enough rural healthcare practitioners mean that these areas experience insufficient care options. Generally, good working opportunity and environment draw physicians and nurses more often than not and concentrate their service in larger cities and metropolitans.

**High turnover rates:** The challenges presented by staying in rural healthcare facilities in terms of retaining medical staff are issues of isolation, lack of professional growth opportunities, and lower salaries compared to their urban counterparts.

# Facility Distribution by Population Density

**Sparse distribution in less populated areas:** Sparsity of spread in rural places with sparsely populated areas: In the low-density population areas, healthcare facilities are more dispersed with severe gaps in service provision.

**More facilities in larger rural towns:** Larger rural communities or county seats tend to have more healthcare facilities and services than remote and sparsely populated areas. Yet even larger towns may experience a shortage of healthcare.

# Tools and Libraries used

**Geospatial Analysis Tools and Libraries**

Purpose: A comprehensive GIS tool used for mapping, spatial analysis, and visualization of healthcare facility distribution.
Use Cases: Mapping healthcare facility locations, analyzing the spatial proximity of facilities to populations, and identifying accessibility barriers, such as distance or transportation.
Key Features: Heat maps, proximity analysis, service area mapping, and geographic overlays.

**Google Earth Engine**

It is a geospatial data processing and analysis platform using satellite imagery and spatial data.
Use Cases: Mapping rural healthcare infrastructure, assessing healthcare access using remote sensing data such as road networks or population density.
Key features: global satellite imagery access, processing of geospatial, time-series analysis.

**Data Visualization:**

Libraries: Chart.js, D3.js, or Plotly.

# Database:

**Relational:** MySQL/PostgreSQL for conventional products and sales data.

**Non-Relational:** MongoDB for not-so-structured data storage.

# Data Source

The dataset which we use for this Assigenment is taken from the kaggle.
Website Link:-https://www.kaggle.com/

# Execution Steps

1.Take the data set(csv file) from Kaggle

2.Open a New notebook in google colab

3.Uplod the csv file which we downloaded into the folder of google colab

4.Then Execute the python code using pandas for dataset

5.Make a bar graph,Line Chart And Histogram Using Matplotlib libraries

6.Save each copy directly into the repository of the github

# Challenges faced

# Conclusion 

In conclusion, the diffusion of health care facilities across the rural areas poses the biggest challenges due to conditions such as low facility densities, geographical isolation, understaffing, and financing constraints. Rural communities would take longer distances to avail basic health care services; hence, the few rare specialties further increase health inequality. These areas are normally served by fewer service delivery facilities and often rely on community health centers, mobile clinics, and telemedicine for filling various care gaps.

An increased chronic disorder burden, lack of road infrastructure and transport availability worsen healthcare challenges in such areas. Another big factor remains healthcare provider recruitment/retention issues where in the providers have better care prospects in cities rather in the areas because facilities were more promising along with suitable conditions to live.
